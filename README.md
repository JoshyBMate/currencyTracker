# currencyTracker
tracks the currencies I'm interested in (work in progress)

# Break down
Uses an api to get information about Dollar, Euro and Pound and compares them to the rand.
Updates every hour (only way to use the api for free)
Emails me when the Dollar hits a break point (ie when it goes from 14 Rand to 13 Rand for a dollar) (still need to implement)
